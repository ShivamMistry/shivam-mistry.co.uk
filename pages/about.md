##Introduction
I'm a Computer Science student at the [University of York](http://www.york.ac.uk/). 

I have been programming for several years, however I am most experienced with Java and the JVM, but I also have experience in C, C++, Clojure, Ruby, Pascal, and Python.


##Website
This is a new version of my website. It looks identical to the old one as I am using the same stylesheets.
Eventually I shall update the CSS so it looks nicer, but I now statically serve markdown files.

##Code
The syntax highlighting on this site is provided by [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/description/).

    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World");
        }
    }
